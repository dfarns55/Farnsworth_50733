# Homework Problem 1
# In nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula is a formula for calculating
# the approximate nuclear binding energy of an atomic nucleus Zwith atomic number
# Z and mass number A. The formula looks like this:
# B= a_1*A - a_2*A^(2/3) - a_3*(z^2/A^(1/3) - a_4*((A-2*Z)^2/A) - a_5/A^(1/2)
# where, in units of millions of electron volts (MeV), the constants are
# a_1=15.67, a_2=17.23 , a_3=0.75 , a_4=93.2 and
# a_5 = (0 A is odd, 12.0 A and Z are both even, -12.0 Ais even and Z is odd
# Write a function that takes as its input the values of A and Z, and prints
# out the binding energy for the corresponding atom.
# Use your program to find the binding energy of an atom with A = 58
# and Z=28.


def calculate_binding_energy(Z, A):
    # Constants in Mev
    a1 = 15.67
    a2 = 17.23
    a3 = 0.75
    a4 = 93.2

    # Determine a5 based on A and Z
    if A % 2 != 0:
        a5 = 0  # A is odd
    elif Z % 2 == 0:
        a5 = 12.0  # A and Z are both odd
    else:
        a5 = -12.0  # A is even and Z is odd

    # Calculating binding energy using the semi-empirial mass formula
    term1 = a1 * A
    term2 = - a2 * A**(2 / 3)
    term3 = - a3 * (Z**2 / A**(1 / 3))
    term4 = - a4 * ((A - 2 * Z)**2 / A)
    term5 = - a5 / A**(1 / 2)

    binding_energy = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5
    return binding_energy


# Example Usage: Calculate binding energy for Z = 28 and A = 58
Z = 28
A = 58
binding_energy = calculate_binding_energy(Z, A)

# Homework Problem 2
# Now create a new function that calculates the binding energy per nucleon, B/A.
# You shoudl be able to write a very short function that call your previous
# function to do the heavy lifting. Test you function with some famous cases:
# Iron 56 and Carbon 12.

# Homework Problem 3
# Create yet another function that takes a single argument, Z, and finds the
# value of A at which the binding energy per nucleon is largest. You are aided
# in this problem in the fact that A is discrete; you can simply check all
# reasonable values without worrying about mimizing a function or any such
# thing. You should be able to easily determine the minimum value for A. If
# you consult a table of nuclides, you'll see some elements have nuclides,
# with measured half lives, with A > 2Z, so in this exercise use A = 3Z as an
# upper limit.

# Homework Problem 5
# It's a common situation in physics that an experiment produces data that lies roughly on a straight line.
# The straight line can be represented in the familiar form y=mx+b and a frequent question is what the
# appropriate values of the slope and intercepti c are that correspond to the measured data. Since the
# data don't fall perfectly on a straight line, there is no perfect answer to such a question, but we can
# find the straight line that gives the best compromise fit to the data. The standard technique for doing
# this is the method of least squares.
# In this repo is a file called millikan.txt. The file contains two columns of numbers, giving the
# x and y coordinates of a set of data points. Write a program to read these data points and make a graph
