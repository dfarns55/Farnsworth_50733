# Homework 1 problem 7

In millikan.txt, we have values of $\nu$ and V. We estimated the following
regression equation in problem 6:

$$
V = m\cdot\nu + c
$$
with values of $m=4.09e-15$ and $c=-1.73$

From Albert Einstein's equation,  we see that

$$
V = (h/e)\cdot\nu - \phi
$$


Therefore $h = m\cdot e = h=6.549340228345061e-34$
